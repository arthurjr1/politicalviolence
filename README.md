# [Examining the Relationship between Political Violence and Regions in Africa](https://arthurjr1.github.io/politicalviolence/)

Political violence is a pervasive problem in many African countries, and it has significant implications for Africa's development and well-being of Africans. This study aims to examine the relationship between political violence and the occurrence of death across Africa as part of a poster presentation assignment for a data analysis course. Using the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) data, this presentation uses Rmarkdown to answer whether there is a negative relationship between political violence and fatalities due to the political event transpiring.

The ACLED is large is to upload to Github so you will have to create access the file via their [website](https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/).
